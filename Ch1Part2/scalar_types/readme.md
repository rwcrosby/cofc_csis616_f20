# Scalar types in `Rust`

https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types.html

## Integers

    - unsigned
    - signed

## Floats

    - Exponential constants

## Booleans

    - `true` and `false`
    - No automatic conversion between other types and bool

## Type conversion

    - `Rust` is strongly types. 
    - Convert using 

        ```
        val as type
        123 as f32
        ```

## Parameter passing

    - Pass by value
    - Use references to pass by address
    - Mutable vs. immutable references

## Mutability and references

    - Mutable - Only one reference allowed
    - Immutable - Multiple immutable references allowed
