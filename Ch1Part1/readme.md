# Chapter 1, Sections 1 and 2

- Directory `hello_rust`

    A simple `hello world` type program generated by:

    ```
    cargo init hello_rust
    ```

- Directory `gcd_1`

    Contains the first version of the greatest common denominator program containing only the gcd function and a test function.

    - To build, from within the directory:

        ```
        cargo build
        ```

    - To run the tests, from within the directory:

        ```
        cargo test
        ```

- Directory `gcd_21

    Contains the `gcd` function from `gcd_1` with an expanded main program added.

    - Build and test same as `gcd_1`

    - To run the program, from within the directory:

        ```
        cargo run Numbers
        ```

        Where: `Numbers` are a list of 1 or more integers
    
- Files `Ch1Part1.ipynb` and `Ch1Part1.pdf` 

    Jupyter notebook (and a .pdf export of it) for the examples discussed in class. 

    To run you will need: 
    
    - a python version 3 installation with the jupyter and graphviz packages installed.
    - an installation of the graphviz utility.

- File `VirtualWhiteBoard.pdf`

    The marginally legible scribblings I did on the iPad through the class.
